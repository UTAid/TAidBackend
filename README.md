# TAid

**TAid** is an application for managing grades and courses.
Developed for Anya Tafliovich at UTSC.


## Requirements

Please see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for updated requirements.
At the minimum this project will need Django 1.11.


## Installation

It is recommended to have `pip` and `virtualenvwrapper` setup on your base machine for development.
Clone this repo to your destination.
Just run `pip3 install -r requirments.txt` inside of a virtualenv to download all your dependencies.

### Set-up
The code uses python3. Follow the instructions to setup a local server in your machine:
* `sudo apt-get install python3-pip` - This will install pip
* `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` - This will install all the dependencies found in the requirements.txt file
* `python3 manage.py makemigrations` - Creates new migrations based on the changes you have made to your models
* `python3 manage.py migrate` - Applies the migrations and sets up the database
* `python3 manage.py createsuperuser` - Sets up an admin user (follow instructions on screen)
* `python3 manage.py runserver` - This sets up a development server on the local pc

### Exploring the development server
The development server will most likely will be set as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` but if otherwise it will say so on the screen when `python3 manage.py runserver` is run
* `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` will take to the admin page. Put in the credentials that were made during the set-up process
* `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v0/` will take to the api page. If not logged in, click on login button top right corner of screen and provide admin credentials.
  * Now going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v0/` will show more information on the screen of the links where different API requests can be made
  * Now going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v0/docs/` will show the operations available to the rest api
* `http://127.0.0.1:8000/calender-list/` will take to the calender page. If there are no hyperlinks available, create an event (can be found in lecture, tutorial, practical).

## Testing
Run `python3 manage.py test`

## Documentation
Documentation of the overall project can be found in the `docs` folder. A FAQ can also be found there.
